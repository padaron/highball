# About Highball

## What is Highball?

Highball is a native macOS menu bar app that monitors your [Railway](https://railway.com) deployments. It gives you instant visibility into your deployment status without leaving your workflow - just glance at your menu bar to see if your services are healthy, building, or need attention.

## Why "Highball"?

In railroad terminology, a **highball** is a signal meaning "all clear - proceed at full speed." It originated from the practice of hoisting a ball on a pole at train stations to indicate the track ahead was clear.

Since Railway is a modern deployment platform with a train theme, we thought Highball was the perfect name for an app that tells you at a glance whether your deployments are good to go.

When you see that green icon in your menu bar, you've got a highball - full speed ahead.
